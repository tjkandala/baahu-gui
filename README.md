# Baahu GUI

## What is Baahu GUI?

A WIP "software development kit" for [Baahu](https://github.com/tjkandala/baahu) applications. It is a GUI for scaffolding, developing, and building Baahu applications.

### Prospective features

- scaffold Baahu applications
- fast, minimalistic module bundler
- choose routes/components to code split from the GUI
- scaffold new component files from the GUI
- built in benchmarks to ensure peak performance. creating good benchmarks is hard, so Baahu GUI will ship with customizable benchmarks with good defaults.

## Why a GUI and not a CLI?

GUIs can be more discoverable than CLIs. If you an expert CLI user, your productivity difference between GUIs and CLIs will be minimal. However, [novices will usually be much slower with a text-based interface](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2655855/).

A major goal is to reduce the barrier of entry to create **quality** web applications.

## When will Baahu GUI be ready to use?

There are two tasks blocking the 1.0.0 release of Baahu (the framework):

1. Completion of Baahu GUI for ease of use
2. Completion of a non-trivial (closed source) "dogfood" Baahu app to increase confidence that Baahu is production-ready
